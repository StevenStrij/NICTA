Wireless
Within NICTA there are a number of wireless networks available.

nicta_wireless
Open network, firewalled from almost everything. You get access to the NICTA VPN, and ssh access to anywhere, and that's about it.

nicta_visitor
Open network, using Web-based authentication. Password changes regularly, see Visitor Wireless. Firewalled, but generally useful (ssh and web are open). Subscribe to ertos.nicta-wireless-notify (mlalias on duvel) for automated email notifications of password changes.

nicta_secure
WPA2/Enterprise, use NICTA login and password to gain access. Full access to NICTA network.

KEG network.
We run a wireless network on our floor. There is a repeater on level 4, but it's not that reliable.
To connect, use:
ESSID: keg
WPA2 Personal key: 133714cafe
